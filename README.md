# Producer-Consumer-Problem-Java
I recently tackled the classic Producer-Consumer problem using Java and multithreading. This problem is a fundamental example in concurrent programming, showcasing how producers and consumers can work together while sharing a common buffer.

ðŸ§µ What is the Producer-Consumer Problem?
In the Producer-Consumer problem, we have two types of threads:

Producers: Generate data and add it to a shared buffer.
Consumers: Take data from the shared buffer and process it.
The challenge is to ensure that producers don't overflow the buffer and consumers don't try to consume from an empty buffer.

ðŸ”§ My Solution
I implemented this problem using three different approaches in Java:

Using Object as a Lock: Leveraging intrinsic locks with synchronized blocks.

Runnable Interface: Implementing the Runnable interface for producer and consumer classes.

Thread Class: Extending the Thread class for producer and consumer classes.

ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
Thread Safety: Ensuring that shared resources are accessed by one thread at a time.

Synchronization: Using intrinsic locks and condition variables to manage thread execution.

Concurrency Handling: Addressing potential issues like race conditionsÂ andÂ deadlocks.
